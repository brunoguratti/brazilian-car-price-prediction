# Brazilian Car Price Prediction

Predicting the average prices of used cars in Brazil using the FIPE dataset. The dataset includes information about fuel type, engine size, gear, brand, and model, allowing the development of a predictive model to estimate car prices based on these factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by FIPE (Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas), an institute that tracks average prices of used cars in the Brazilian domestic market. It includes relevant features like fuel type, engine size, gear, brand, and model.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the prices of used cars based on input variables. By analyzing the dataset and training a machine learning model, we aim to understand the relationships between car attributes and their prices.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to FIPE for providing the valuable dataset for this project.
